# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in this workspace.

## Environment

- **Platform**: Windows
- **Workspace**: C:\Users\jeastaugh\source\repos\Experiments\PartyDraw
- Use Windows-compatible commands (e.g., use backslashes in paths, no Unix-specific commands)

## Current Task

You are helping the user create a **requirements.md** file for their project.

### Your Job

1. Ask the user what they want to build
2. Break down their project into small, manageable tasks (each ~30 minutes of work)
3. Write tasks to `requirements.md` in the format below
4. Ensure tasks have clear dependencies where needed

### Task Format

Each task in requirements.md MUST follow this exact format:

```markdown
### TASK-001: Task title here
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: high
- **Dependencies**: none
- **Description**: Clear description of what needs to be done.

### TASK-002: Another task
- **Status**: pending
- **Priority**: medium
- **Dependencies**: TASK-001
- **Description**: This task depends on TASK-001 completing first.
```

### Rules

- Task IDs must be sequential: TASK-001, TASK-002, TASK-003, etc.
- Status should always be `pending` for new tasks
- Priority: `high`, `medium`, or `low`
- Dependencies: `none` or comma-separated task IDs (e.g., `TASK-001, TASK-002`)
- Keep descriptions clear and actionable
- The requirements.md file already exists at: C:\Users\jeastaugh\source\repos\Experiments\PartyDraw\requirements.md
